# 📉 Time Series Experiment No. 1: The Phase Shock

## 🎯 Experiment Objective
To investigate the impact of a sudden **Phase Shift (180° / $\pi$ radians)** on a stable periodic signal. This simulates a "system reset" or "timing error" in a continuous process (e.g., a skipped heartbeat or a sensor desynchronization).

## 📊 Visualization
Below is the time-evolution of the signal. The red dashed line marks the moment of intervention ($t=300$).

## 📝 Analysis & Findings

### 1. The Control Phase ($t=[0, 300]$)
* **State:** Stable Equilibrium
* **Parameters:** $\text{Amplitude}=5$, $\text{Period}=10$, $\text{Phase}=0$
* **Observation:** The system exhibits a predictable sinusoidal behavior with regular peaks and valleys. The noise ($\sigma=0.5$) adds realistic jitter but does not obscure the pattern.

### 2. The Intervention ($t=300$)
At point 300, we inject a **Phase Shock** of $\pi$ radians.
* **Mathematical Change:** $\sin(\omega t) \rightarrow \sin(\omega t + \pi)$
* **Effect:** Since $\sin(x + \pi) = -\sin(x)$, the wave instantly flips its sign.

### 3. The Experimental Phase ($t=[300, 400]$)
* **Observation:** Immediately after the vertical black dashed line, observe the **"Broken Rhythm"**.
* **Detail:** At $t=300$, the wave *should* have continued upward to a peak. Instead, the phase shift forces it downward into a valley. This creates a sharp "kink" or discontinuity in the waveform, clearly visible in the visualization.
